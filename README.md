# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects Repository**! 🎯
This repo is dedicated to storing and showcasing **50+ practical machine learning projects**, built step by step as I learn and explore different ML concepts.

Each project is organized into a separate folder (`Project 01`, `Project 02`, etc.) with:

* 📌 A detailed README explaining the dataset, preprocessing, model, and evaluation.
* 📂 Source code (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook style).
* 📊 Visualizations & explanations for easy understanding.

## ✅ Projects Added So Far

### 📂 **Project 01: Diabetes Prediction**

* **Goal:** Predict whether a person is diabetic or not using the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset**.
* **Techniques Used:**

  * Data preprocessing & standardization
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
  * Accuracy evaluation on training & test sets
  * Predictive system for real-world input
* **Result:** Achieved good accuracy in predicting diabetes based on medical attributes.

### 📂 **Project 02: Fake News Prediction**

* **Goal:** Detect whether a news article is **real or fake**.
* **Techniques Used:**

  * Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  * Data cleaning (stopwords removal, stemming, text preprocessing)
  * **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical features
  * Logistic Regression for classification
  * Evaluation with accuracy score
* **Result:** Successfully built a model that classifies news articles as **Fake (1)** or **Real (0)**.
